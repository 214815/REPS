# REPS

This project implements an Energy Management System using Scala. It is compatible with Scala version 3.4.1 and depends on external libraries located in the `lib/` directory. The system uses input data in CSV format, which must be updated regularly from the official data source.

## Requirements

- Scala 3.4.1
- Java 24.0.1
- Required JAR dependencies placed in the `lib/` directory
- Latest CSV data file downloaded from the official website

## Project Structure

```
.
├── lib/ # External JAR dependencies
├── data/ # CSV data files (must be updated)
├── *.scala # Scala source files (main program and modules)
├── *.class, *.tasty # Compiled output files (generated by scalac)
├── README.md
```

## CSV Data

The system uses up-to-date data in CSV format.  
**Please download the latest CSV files from the official data provider before running the application.**  
Download here: [https://data.fingrid.fi/en/datasets](https://data.fingrid.fi/en/datasets)  
Place the downloaded files into the `data/` directory.

## Compilation

To compile the project, navigate to the source directory containing the `.scala` files and run:

```bash
scalac *.scala -classpath "lib/*"
```

Make sure the `lib/` folder contains all required JAR files.

## Running

To run the main class `EnergyManagementSystem`, use the following command:

```bash
scala EnergyManagementSystem -classpath "lib/*"
```

## Notes

* Ensure that Scala 3.4.1 is installed and available in your `PATH`.
* If you encounter a `ClassNotFoundException`, check that all required `.jar` files are correctly placed in the `lib/` folder.
* Always use the most recent CSV data for accurate results.
